write me some boilerplate angular html and css for a component with the following fields:

title: should be <h1> with value: compare artists
searchbar:
    -> default: enter artists name
    -> (input) event listener

search-results:
    -> split into two boxes
    -> on the left: search results from search in searchbar
    -> each item in search results should have an onclick event listener with input being the name of the element
    -> on the right: populated with items by clicking item in left box
    -> each item on the right should also have an onclick event listener with input being the name of the element

detail view:
    ->split into two boxes
    ->on the left: info of selected artist from left box in search results
    ->on the right: same, but from box in search results on the right


the fields are vertically stacked.
search-result boxes are alligned horizontally and each 50% in width and the same height.
detail view boxes same as search-result boxes.
